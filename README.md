<p>An application to optimise the production of carbon dioxide and other chemical elements that can harm the environment, in order to preserve and improve the ecology of our planet.I named this programme after the goddess of forests, trees and animals.</p>
<hr>
<h2> What this app is for? </h2>
<p>At the moment, there is an increase in emissions of harmful chemical elements into the environment.</p>

<p>This app is designed to reduce the production of harmful chemical elements by providing advice and information about a particular product (showing the approximate amount of harmful chemical elements produced during the production of that product).</p>
<hr>
<h2> How it works? </h2>
<p>All products have barcodes,this app will have a scanner, once the product is scanned it will show the manufacturer's company, emissions of harmful chemical elements, greener counterparts of the scanned product. In addition to the scanner there will be a calculator of waste emission in everyday life and tips to reduce waste generation based on your data (artificial intelligence will analyse and search for suitable tips).</p>
<h2>Social aspect of the application</h2>
<p>The application will have an account system where each user can share their achievements by comparing certain time intervals, as well as compete with other users of the application.</p>
<hr>
<h2> Ð¡ompetition </h2>
<p>The competition of this app consists of several similar apps, however, each of these apps has only one of the features of this app, and some features were not seen at all.</p>
<hr>
<h1> Conclusion  </h1>
 <p> An eco-friendly programme with many useful features. </p>
